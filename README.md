# Landing Page Project

This is the repo for my version of The Odin Project's "Landing Page" project from the Foundations course.

The goal of this project is to create a landing page using HTML and CSS from scratch by primarily utilizing CSS flexbox components. The basic design for the page was provided by The Odin Project. Below is my final implementation of the design, and a screenshot of the provided design for comparison.
