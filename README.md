# Landing Page Project

This is the repo for my version of The Odin Project's "Landing Page" project from the Foundations course.

The goal of this project is to create a landing page using HTML and CSS from scratch by primarily utilizing CSS flexbox components. The primary objective was to create the design file in HTML and CSS from scratch, but not necessarily to have a 100% pixel perfect match, as no padding or sizing information was provided beyond font sizes and styling. Additionally, the final landing page is _not_ meant to be responsive, as THe Odin Project covers responsive design later in the course.

The basic design for the page was provided by The Odin Project. Below is my final implementation of the design, and a screenshot of the provided design for comparison.

My implementation can also be viewed here: https://mselchow.github.io/odin-landing-page/
